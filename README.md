MonaLisa Resume Assistant is a web application designed to help job seekers match their resumes with job descriptions. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze the relevance of a resume for a specific job description and provides a match score.

## üìù Project Overview
**MonaLisa Resume Assistant** is an AI-powered tool that helps users match their resumes with job descriptions to improve their chances of landing interviews. The application is built using Flask for the backend and a pre-trained machine learning model for resume analysis.

### ‚ö° Features
- Upload your resume (PDF format) and paste a job description to get a match score.
- Uses NLP techniques to categorize resumes and calculate relevance scores.
- User-friendly web interface with responsive design.
- Built with scalable technologies, suitable for deployment on cloud platforms.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model
The core of this project is a machine learning model that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze resumes.

### How It Works:
1. **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF resumes using `PyPDF2`.
2. **Text Vectorization**: Uses `TfidfVectorizer` from `scikit-learn` to convert text into numerical vectors.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates the similarity score between the resume and job description.
4. **Classification**: The model categorizes the resume into domains (e.g., Data Science, Software Engineering).
